* Create a database with the name you used in <b>connec.php</b> file : `create database database_name;`
* Import <b>dataV1.sql</b> file (at the root of the project) in your SQL server
* Launch the PHP internal server with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
* Follow the instructions on the home page carefully.
* Commit your changes on a branch named as **CAMPUS_NOM_Prenom** *(i.e. NANTES_LEGUENEC_Erwan)*
